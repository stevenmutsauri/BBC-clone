      "headline": "India rebukes UK MPs over farmers' protest debate",
      "description": "India has rebuked UK MPs for criticising its handling of long-running farmers' protests in Delhi. Several Labour, Liberal Democrat and Scottish National Party MPs on Monday expressed concern over the safety of protesters and the status of press freedom in India. But India's High Commission in London said the parliamentary discussion was full of 'false assertions'. Indian farmers have been protesting for months against agricultural reforms. Thousands of them have been camped on the outskirts of the capital Delhi, demanding the government repeal the laws, which seek to further open up India's farming sector to private players. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party-led government insist the laws will improve farmers' incomes. But farmers say the opposite will happen since the reforms give corporate companies greater bargaining power. The protests - which have lasted for more than 100 days - have dominated headlines and social media feeds, and the government's response has drawn international attention and even rebuke. India's government has shut down the internet around the protest sites for brief spells, arrested protesters, sympathetic activists and even journalists covering the strike. Citing these instances, UK MPs said human rights and democratic freedoms were not being upheld in India, reports the BBC's Yogita Limaye. 'Water cannons and tear gas and repeated clashes between police and farmers and interruption in internet connectivity have been matters of concern. Several farmers have reportedly committed suicide,' SNP MP Martin Day said.",

It attributed the downgrade to increased pressure on human rights groups, journalists and activists, and targeting of minorities, since 2014, when Mr Modi swept to power. But the Indian government's response to the protest - which has included criminal charges against eight journalists, the controversial arrest of a 22-year-old activist and a spat with pop star Rihanna - has sparked anger and criticism in India as well."

      "headline": "Farm laws: Are India's new reforms a 'death warrant' for farmers?",
      "description": "Three contentious laws that will change the way India's farmers do business have sparked one of India's biggest protests and a months-long standoff with the government. Since November, tens of thousands of protesting farmers demanding repeal of the laws have been camping out on highways on the outskirts of Delhi. The parliament passed the three bills in September, which were then signed into law by the president. Opposition parties accused the government of flouting parliamentary procedure by passing the bills hurriedly and not listening to their demand of sending the bills to a parliamentary committee for further deliberations. But beyond the political fracas, the bills have also split opinions - while Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the reforms a 'watershed moment for Indian agriculture, opposition parties have termed them 'anti-farmer and likened them to a 'death warrant'. Angry and worried farmer groups see them as unfair and exploitative. Pro-reform economists have largely welcomed the move, saying the new laws will help improve farm incomes, attract investment and technology, and increase productivity. Nearly a dozen rounds of talks between the 30-odd farmer unions and the government have yielded no results.",

They also allow private buyers to hoard essential commodities for future sales, which only government-authorised agents could do earlier; and they outline rules for contract farming, where farmers tailor their production to suit a specific buyer's demand. One of the biggest changes is that farmers will be allowed to sell their produce at a market price directly to private players - agricultural businesses, supermarket chains and online grocers. Most Indian farmers currently sell the majority of their produce at government-controlled wholesale markets or mandis at assured floor prices."

          "sub_description": "The issue is that it's unclear how this will play out in reality. For one, farmers can already sell to private players in many states but what these bills do is offer a national framework. But farmers are mainly concerned that this will eventually lead to the end of wholesale markets and assured prices, leaving them with no back-up option. That is, if they are not satisfied with the price offered by a private buyer, they cannot return to the mandi or use it as a bargaining chip during negotiations."

One protester died and some 500 policemen were injured. Farm union leaders condemned the violence and blamed the chaos on rogue elements among an otherwise peaceful march. Many said the protests have lost their legitimacy after the violence. Others said the farmers should accept the government's offer to put the reforms on hold and return home. Since early February, iron nails, rods, barbed wire, boulders and makeshift walls have been used to barricade the capital's borders against the protesters. But the farmers have refused to leave and are not budging from their demand. The protest is now in its third month, and there is no solution in sight."

But why is the resurgence happening only in a handful of states, particularly in Maharashtra? Mr Menon says the only reasonable conclusion is that surveillance in these states is stronger and that a similar rise in other states may simply have gone undetected so far. Another possible reason, experts say, could be mutation. Viruses often mutate to change their genetic code, which is like their instruction manual. Mutations allow viruses to spread faster and, in some cases, render antibodies less effective."

India imposed a sweeping, early shutdown in late March to halt the spread of the virus. Scientists believe that the shutdown, which stretched to nearly 70 days, did prevent a lot of infections and deaths.

'I got 600 million doses worth of glass vials ahead of time and locked it in my warehouse by September,' he explained. 'The most important part that enabled us to have so many doses - 70-80 million in January - was because I started manufacturing at risk in August.' 'I wish other companies also had taken that risk, because the world would have had many more doses.' Mr Poonawalla criticised the patchwork of global regulatory systems and lack of harmonisation for production delays. He said the major regulators, including the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), could have united and agreed a quality standard. He also criticised national governments, claiming that regulators in the countries that are making the vaccines, from India to Europe, could have united to agree a standard international benchmark."

In India, SII is also involved the world's largest inoculation programme, to vaccinate 300 million by August. But, according to Bloomberg, only 56% of people eligible to get a shot have actually stepped forward. 'A lot of vaccine hesitancy traditionally has come about when either celebrities or non-experts have said vaccines are not safe,' said Mr Poonawalla. 'I always just request celebrities and others who have this tremendous power on the social networks, to just be a bit responsible and read up on the facts before they say anything."

So what did the chief justice say that has angered people so much? He asked two 'atrocious' questions.",

In 1990 there were more than 750 million people in China living below the international poverty line - about two-thirds of the population. By 2012, that had fallen to fewer than 90 million, and by 2016 - the most recent year for which World Bank figures are available - it had fallen to 7.2 million people (0.5% of the population). So clearly, even in 2016 China was well on the way to reaching its target. This suggests that overall, 745 million fewer people were living in extreme poverty in China than were 30 years ago. World Bank figures do not take us to the present day, but the trend is certainly in line with the Chinese government's announcement. Elsewhere in the region, Vietnam has also seen a dramatic fall in extreme poverty rates over a similar period. Another large country, India, had 22% of its population living below the international poverty line in 2011 (the most recent data available). Brazil has 4.4% of its people earning less than $1.90 a day."
